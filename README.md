# Snakes-and-Ladders-Game:
This is a first and basic project on the Snakes and Ladders classic board game but implementated as a consoled-based game as part of the Data Structures and Algorithms (*Estructures de Dades i Algorismes*) course. The project was created by Xavier Riera and Pau Noguera and focuses on the design and implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms in C. The game models the board, tiles, game state, and gameplay logic using custom structures, dynamic memory allocation, and file-based board initialization.

To play the game you have to open .exe file that can be found in: cmake-build-debug/snakesnladders.exe.
